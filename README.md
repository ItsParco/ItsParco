# 😴 It's Parco

A super ultra mega lazy human being... who somehow still enjoys coding.  
While others chase deadlines, I chase the _perfect nap duration_.

## 🌌 Midnight Debugger at Heart

I come alive between 11PM and “oh no, it’s already 4AM.”  
With lo-fi beats playing and error messages piling up,  
I somehow find that one last fix —  
like using your final potion right before the boss fight.

## 🧪 Special Skills

- Turning caffeine into buggy scripts that _somehow work_
- Debugging at 3AM with lo-fi and mild existential crises
- Writing code that looks like chaos... but still runs (most of the time)

## 🧑‍💻 A Beginner Coder

I'm still learning the ropes and enjoying every step of the journey.  
Though a beginner, I’m curious and motivated to improve every day

## 💻 Preferred Weapons

`Python`, `Node.js`, `Vue`, and the occasional `Arduino` spell  
(for those rare moments when I feel brave enough to fight with hardware)
